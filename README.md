# Schemer

Basic Scheme interpreter written in C++, probably doesn't follow all the standards


- Number of lines:
*cat *.cpp *.h|grep -vP '^\s*$'|wc -l



# TODO
- Change argvments to some other argument parser
- Fix up how the native functions work, the argument checking is a mess
- Actually, add more argument checking in general
- Fix memory leak!!
